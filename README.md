# Modules
Based on my experiences, the more modular the hardware design is, in building a system or device (whether industrial or educational), the healthier your nerves will be at the end of the project. 
Because :

1. Soldering and assembling will be much easier (especially in mass production circulation)

2. It will be much easier to set up, especially since most modules have a good user interface because of their silkscreen on their PCBs.

3. Troubleshooting will be surprisingly easier and will save time, energy and ofcourse money.

4. Due to the small size of most modules, they can be trusted to a large extent in terms of tests related to environmental and system disturbances(EMC , EMI) (of course, this requires expertise - discussion and testing).

Finally, it is necessary to point out that in military boards, you cannot use the usual modules in the market, and if we are going to use modular way circuits, it must be done in a completely professional manner, and considerations of military systems.
